This is the Challenge 5 of the Bootcamp 


## SUMMARY Merging different data frames
#### We are going to use pandas and python to utilize DataFrames. This data will be then presented in nice looking graphs using the matplotlib library. 
#### We are working on a company similar to Uber and we need to show our CEO some business strategies.

#### In above we are loaded the files containing the data, afterwards we merge them "pd.merge" with the use of "City"

### Afterwards we just do math between the data and then create a Data Frame that sup<img width="820" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-08 at 12 55 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25726054/128639486-785fbb49-5cc5-4ce3-bf6c-7b327b447dc9.png">


### We keep merging data frames 

### At the end we are going to use the data frame to create a table <img width="812" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-08 at 1 00 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25726054/128639604-f37d1651-2ac8-406c-acc0-af37a2e2e43f.png">

### We then take advantage of matplotlib and get a nice looking graph where the data is easily able to read:

## Three business recommendations to the CEO
### 1. The urban cities are the ones that create the less profit. The fares are huge! 
### 2. Send more drivers to the Rural cities, this is where the fares are the lowest so profits are higher.
### 3. Maybe decrease the fare price to the urban areas so that it can math up the rural and the suburban.
